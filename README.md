## üîß Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17 or later
- MongoDB database (local or Atlas)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/globetrotter.git
   cd globetrotter
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key  # Optional, for future map features
   ```

   Note: For MongoDB Atlas, your connection string should look like:

   ```
   mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=YourAppName
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## üöÄ Deployment and Production Setup

### Preparing for Production

1. Build the application:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Test the production build locally:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Deployment Options

#### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Import the project in Vercel
3. Configure the environment variables:
   - `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: Your production URL (e.g., https://your-app.vercel.app)
   - `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google API key (if using map features)
4. Deploy the application

#### Other Hosting Providers

For other hosting providers like Netlify, Railway, or a custom server:

1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Set up the environment variables
3. Deploy the `out` directory or follow the hosting provider's instructions

### Production Optimizations

1. **Database Indexing**: Ensure proper indexes are set up in MongoDB:

   ```bash
   node scripts/check-db-indexes.js
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**: Double-check all environment variables are correctly set in your production environment

3. **Error Monitoring**: Consider adding an error monitoring service like Sentry

4. **Performance Monitoring**: Set up performance monitoring with tools like Vercel Analytics or Google Analytics

5. **Security Headers**: Configure security headers in your `next.config.ts` file:
   ```typescript
   const nextConfig = {
     // ... other config
     headers: async () => [
       {
         source: "/(.*)",
         headers: [
           {
             key: "X-Content-Type-Options",
             value: "nosniff",
           },
           {
             key: "X-Frame-Options",
             value: "DENY",
           },
           {
             key: "X-XSS-Protection",
             value: "1; mode=block",
           },
         ],
       },
     ],
   };
   ```

   - Verify your connection string in `.env.local`
   - Ensure your IP address is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas
   - Check for proper username/password in the connection string

2. **API Errors**:

   - Check the browser console and server logs for error messages
   - Verify that all API routes are correctly implemented
   - Ensure MongoDB models match the expected schema

3. **Challenge Creation Issues**:
   - Make sure the username is at least 3 characters
   - Check that the MongoDB connection is working properly
   - Verify that the Challenge model is correctly defined

### Database Maintenance
